Contributions Week 1:
---------------------

The following files are the main UI / Frontend components built using a standard DHTML tech stack.
The UI is built using Bootstrap, jQuery, and vanilla Javascript. The relevant libraries are included in src/frontend/dependencies.

- src/frontend/index.html
- src/frontend/script.js
- src/frontend/style.css

Note: Some of the content that would be available in the final product is not currently displayed in this UI since the data for it relies on API connections.

Left to do:
- Finish any remaining UI components
- Connect the UI to the backend via Java servlets / API
- Get the entire web-app running successfully in an Apache Tomcat server

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 2 deliverable.
You can list the java files that you wrote and committed during the first week,
or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or
other content that your can commit, provide a list of the work that you did
during week 2. Make sure that all your week 2 contributions and this section
of the readme are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo by the week 2 deadline
on 12/01 at 11:59pm CST.>

Contributions Week 3:

<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 3 deliverable.

Files written by me:

<List ALL of the source files here that were written by you. Note that each of the
files must contain correct file headers, including your name, team, and role. List
files one per line in this section of the README. Only complete this section with
your final week 3 submission of project four.>

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<If you have any files written by you or your team in your submission that were
written for an earlier project and that you re-used for project four, replace this
text with a list of these files. Provide file name and path as well as the project
that they were originally developed for.>

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
<If you and your team have written a web app that is available on the internet,
replace this text with its address. This is not a requirement of Project Four
and you will not loose points for not implementing a web application or for not
having a running version on the web.>

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
<List any additional notes for the grader here (only required by the final deadline).>

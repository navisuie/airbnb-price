Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
backend_test.java

For week one I created the names for the 3 tests that will be used to test backened as of right now. Next week I will implement the tests and continue to
expand on the tests.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
backend_test.java

Starting creating test for the load functions but continued to run into InvoccableErrors so I am activily trying to solve that before creating more error prone tests.
Most errors are from source problems that will be resolved soon

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
backend_test.java
backend.java
All data files

Updated tests to work with current version of backend and re-formated all data files to allow for the backend to read it without creating null and indexing erros.

Files written by me:
--------------------

backend.java

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HashTableMap.java
MapADT.java
Node.java

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
localhost:8080/AirBnB/

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
The compilation process of creating the .war file sometimes messes up the ability for the test file to run and errors with MakeFile. I am able to run the tests through JUnit in the IDE but I am currently stuggling to create a solution to this problem.
Unfortunatly the MakeFile does not appear to run the tests properly and only outputs that 2 containers were found and that no tests were found.

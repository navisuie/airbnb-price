Instructions to Run Group BC's AirBnB App

Linux

1. Check to make sure you have a version of java installed on your machine using a terminal
> java -version

2. Go to https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi and download the zip file located under Binary Distributions > Core > zip.

3. Unzip the downloaded file in your machine's Downloads folder

4. Create a Tomcat folder on your system under /Library/Tomcat
> sudo mkdir -p /Library/Tomcat

5. Move the unzipped Tomcat directory to the system Tomcat folder you just created
> sudo mv ~/Downloads/apache-tomcat-7.0.107 /Library/Tomcat

6. Make sure all scripts within the tomcat installation directory are executable
> sudo chmod +x /Library/Tomcat/apache-tomcat-7.0.107/bin/*.sh

7. Run the project Makefile. This will package the project into a .WAR file and copy the .WAR file into the */apache-tomcat-7.0.107/webapps directory

NOTE: This step requires you to have your apache-tomcat-7.0.107 directory located at /Library/Tomcat

8. Open a terminal window and cd into the apache-tomcat-7.0.107 base directory
> cd /Library/Tomcat/apache-tomcat-7.0.107

8. Start the Tomcat server from the command line
> sudo ./bin/startup.sh

9. The application will now be running at http://localhost:8080/AirBnB

10. To stop the Tomcat server from inside the apache-tomcat-7.0.107 home directory, run
> sudo ./bin/shutdown.sh

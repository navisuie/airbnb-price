Instructions to Run Group BC's AirBnB App

1. Copy the project directory for each group member onto one of the Linux-based CS Lab machines (rockhopper, royal, etc)

2. Ensure there is a default browser selected for the CS Lab Machine, under Settings > Default Applications

3. cd into the /AirBnB subdirectory of the current project you are testing
- For example.. jlorenz_Front_End_Developer_2/AirBnB

4. Run 'make' inside of the /AirBnB directory

NOTE: If, for some reason, a browser does not automatically open after running make, manually go to http://localhost:8080/AirBnB after running make to use the application.
When you run make, you should get a confirmation that Tomcat server has started.

5. To ensure the Tomcat server is stopped after you are done testing, make sure to run 'make clean'
